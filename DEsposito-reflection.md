# Reflection For GPS 1.1

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? :
    I was mostly struggling with the when to push, and also just solidifying concepts in my mind. I felt like I had a tenuous grasp on the concepts (add, fetch, merge, etc.) but that they weren't really ingrained in my brain. They still feel a little sketchy at times, but my confidence is growing and I feel I'm getting better at using the commands properly, and understanding the how/why/etc.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS? : I feel that I now know 
    how often to push versus add/commit. I also feel that the concept of not turning my desktop (or my pairs) into a repository has been drilled into my brain. I also was reminded to only run git commands in a git folder, and that I can/should double check that I'm in the correct folder.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? : While I can't 
    recall each question, I do remember asking my guide how often to push, and also what would happen if one were to accidentally make their desktop into a git folder. I didn't have too many questions for my pair, but I did enjoy discussing points where we got stuck and figuring out how best to work through them.

* What still confuses you about Git? : Git itself seems pretty clear to 
    me; however, I still stumble over what the difference between git push and git push -u. Oh, and I'm not sure what to do if you already pushed something but need to modify the file after the push (what happens if you re-push it?).

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? : I really enjoyed 
    pairing in a GPS. I found that it was a good way to solidify my own knowledge, and also to have the safety net of a guide which allowed us to experiment a bit, knowing that if we were about to make a huge mistake, that we would be stopped, but that we were safe to try things out and experiment so we could learn by doing. I found that my pair and I clicked pretty well, and that we were able to problem-solve together in order to accomplish the tasks set out before us. I also really liked the "hands off" approach of our guide and that "hands off" didn't mean inattentive. I found he was really tuned in, watching our progress, and able to provide some great feedback and answers to our questions.
